# Questions About Project Setup and Assumptions

## Python Environment Questions

1. **Python Path Issues**: Why is the setup script failing on Python detection? Is it because macOS has deprecated `python` and only has `python3` by default? Should we update the setup script to try `python3` first, then fallback to `python`?

2. **Virtual Environment Path**: Are we assuming the virtual environment is always named "venv" and located at the project root? Should we allow customizing this?

3. **Python Version Compatibility**: Are we testing with different Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)? Some modules might behave differently across versions.

## Node.js and NPM Questions

1. **Tailwind CSS v4 Availability**: The project specifies Tailwind CSS v4.0.0, but is this version publicly available? Tailwind CSS is currently at v3.x. Is this a typo?

2. **Global vs Local Installation**: Should we be using globally installed Tailwind CSS or local installation? The setup script tries both.

3. **NPM vs Yarn**: Should we support both NPM and Yarn package managers?

## Operating System Questions

1. **macOS Path Differences**: Are we handling the differences in macOS Homebrew Python installations correctly? They often install to /usr/local/bin/python3.

2. **macOS Permissions**: Are there any special permissions needed for running the setup script on macOS?

3. **Missing .env.example**: The README refers to a .env.example file that doesn't exist. Should we create this?

## Database Questions

1. **Database Initialization**: The setup script doesn't initialize the database. Should it run the migration commands automatically?

2. **Database Path**: Where should the SQLite database file be located? Is ./app.db the correct path?

## Fallback Mechanisms Questions

1. **CSS Fallback Completeness**: The current CSS fallback is minimal. Should we expand it to better match DaisyUI components?

2. **CDN Fallback**: Should we provide a CDN fallback for Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI in the HTML templates?

## General Project Questions

1. **Error Handling**: How comprehensive should error handling be in the setup script?

2. **Minimum Requirements**: What are the minimum versions of Python and Node.js that we want to support?

3. **Deployment Target**: Is this primarily for local development, or should the setup script handle production deployment configurations?
