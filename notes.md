## Recent Challenges (March 31, 2025)

1. **Python Version Compatibility**:
   - ❌ Initial attempt to use Python 3.13 failed due to pydantic compatibility issues
   - ✅ Successfully switched to Python 3.11 using Homebrew
   - 🔄 Consider adding Python version compatibility check to setup script

2. **Dependency Installation**:
   - ❌ Initial pip install failed due to missing Rust toolchain
   - ✅ Installed Rust and successfully installed Python dependencies
   - 🔄 Add Rust toolchain check to prerequisites

3. **CSS Framework Issues**:
   - ❌ Tailwind CSS installation and build process failed
   - ✅ Switched to custom CSS solution with variables and modern features
   - 🔄 Document both Tailwind and custom CSS approaches

4. **Server Errors**:
   - ❌ Encountered 500 server error on initial setup
   - ✅ Fixed by:
     - Creating proper .env file with all required variables
     - Updating templates to use correct CSS classes
     - Adding error page styling
   - 🔄 Add automated environment configuration check

5. **Authentication Flow**:
   - ❌ Initial cookie name mismatch between code and configuration
   - ✅ Standardized on 'oz_nula_auth' across all files
   - 🔄 Add configuration validation for auth settings

## Immediate TODOs

1. Add automated checks for:
   - Python version compatibility
   - Required system dependencies (Rust, etc.)
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Template and static file integrity

2. Improve error handling:
   - Add more descriptive error messages
   - Implement proper logging
   - Add development-specific error pages with debug info

3. Documentation updates:
   - Add troubleshooting section for common setup issues
   - Document Python version requirements
   - Add section about CSS customization options

## Latest Findings (March 31, 2025)

1. **Server Startup Issues**:
   - ❌ Server not accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000

     - Added connection verification steps
     - Added more detailed logging

2. **Database Improvements**:
   - ✅ Added connection timeout settings
   - ✅ Added pool pre-ping for better connection handling
   - ✅ Improved table verification process
   - ✅ Better error logging without crashing the application
   - 🔄 TODO: Add database migration support

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Implement proper database migrations with Alembic
   - Add health check endpoint that includes database status
   - Add proper error recovery mechanisms
   - Implement proper session management
   - Add database connection retry logic
